## The most annoying things in linux terminal

First, it's the ctrl+shift+v to paste shit, you know what every time you press those it will add soemthing for you in front of your content. i can't remeber the exact words now(it may is sth like this ^HD). And then still about copy and paste, it don't have clipboard,,, which i just press win + v in windows(yeah it's just i don't install the software) but i don't need install any to achive this in windows... I will admit kill a process in linux is more easy, way too easy. and delete all PC is also easy you know rm -rf / shit...

## how to slove 

i need to shut this my windows off to look into my arch linux, i have two operating systems in my laptop. and the arch Linux is pretty good. I have cilipboard and I have changed ctrl+c and ctrl+v in terminal.. ah seem install kde plasa will slove the problem.

chat-gpt tell me 

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

but this took so many time, maybe i shoudn't run this..

then 

```
sudo apt install -y kali-desktop-kde
```

switch 
```
sudo systemctl disable lightdm
sudo systemctl enable sddm
```

oh, plasa have 4 to choose, some of them are just dark screen, i'm using plasam x11 it works fine. but sddm seem more source consuming. so better using lightdm....
